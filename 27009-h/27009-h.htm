<h3>PARTY-SIMILES OF THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY&mdash;NO.
I. "FOXES AND FIREBRANDS." NO. II. "THE
TROJAN HORSE."</h3>

  <p>With Englishmen, at least, the seventeenth was a century pre-eminent
  for quaint conceits and fantastic similes: the literature of that period,
  whether devotional, poetical, or polemical<a name="footnotetag1"
  href="#footnote1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>, was alike infected with the
  universal mania for strained metaphors, and men vied with each other in
  giving extraordinary titles to books, and making the <!-- Page 486
  --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page486"></a>{486}</span>contents
  justify the title. Extravagance and the far-fetched were the gauge of
  wit: Donne, Herbert, and many a man of genius foundered on this rock, as
  well as Cowley, who acted up to his own definition:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"In a true Piece of Wit <i>all things</i> must be,</p>
      <p class="i1">Yet all things there agree;</p>
      <p>As in the <i>Ark</i>, join'd without force or strife,</p>
      <p>All creatures dwelt&mdash;all creatures that had life."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>It is not, however, for the purpose of illustrating this mania that I
  am about to dwell on the two similes which form the subject of my present
  Note: I selected them as favourite party-similes which formed a standing
  dish for old Anglican writers; and also because they throw light on the
  history of religious party in England, and thus form a suitable
  supplement to my article on "High Church and Low Church" (Vol. viii., p.
  117.).</p>

  <p>As the object of the Church of England, in separating from Rome, was
  the <i>reformation</i>, not the <i>destruction</i> of her former faith,
  by the very act of reformation she found herself opposed to two bodies;
  namely, <i>that</i> from which she separated, and the ultra-reformers or
  Puritans, who clamoured for a <i>radical</i> reformation.</p>

  <p>Taking these as the Scylla and Charybdis&mdash;the two extremes to be
  avoided&mdash;the Anglican Church hoped to attain the safe and golden
  mean by steering between these opposites, and find, in this <i>via
  media</i> course, the path of truth.</p>

  <p>Accordingly, her divines abound with warnings against the aforesaid
  Scylla and Charybdis, and with exhortations to cleave to the middle line
  of safety. Acting on the proverb that <i>extremes meet</i>, they were
  ever drawing parallels between their two opponents. On the other hand,
  the Puritans stoutly contended that <i>they</i> were the true middle-men;
  and in their turn traced divers similarities and parallels betwixt
  "Popery and Prelacy," the "Mass Book and Service Book."<a
  name="footnotetag2" href="#footnote2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Without farther preface, I shall give the title of a curious work,
  which will tell its own story:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Foxes and Firebrands</i>; or <i>A Specimen of the Danger and
  Harmony of Popery and Separation</i>. Wherein is proved from undeniable
  Matter of Fact and Reason, that Separation from the Church of England is,
  in the Judgment of Papists, and by Experience, found the most Compendious
  way to introduce Popery, and to ruine the Protestant Religion:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg1">'<i>Tantum Religio potuit suadere Malorum.</i>'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</blockquote>

  <p>A work under this title was published, if I mistake not, in London in
  1678 by Dr. Henry Nalson; in 1682, Robert Ware reprinted it with a second
  part of his own; and in 1689 he added a <i>third</i> and last part in
  12mo., uniform with the previous volume.<a name="footnotetag3"
  href="#footnote3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> In the Epist. Ded. to Part II. the
  writer says of the Church of England:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Papists on the one hand, and the Puritans on the other, did
  endeavour to sully and bespatter the glory of her Reformation: the one
  taxing it with innovation, and the other with superstition."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The Preface to the Third Part declares that the object of the whole
  work is "to reclaim the most haggard Papists" and Puritans.</p>

  <p>Wheatly, in treating of the State Service for the 29th of May,
  remarks:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Papists and Sectaries, like Sampson's Foxes, though they look
  contrary ways, do yet both join in carrying Fire to destroy us: their End
  is the same, though the method be different."&mdash;<i>Rational Illust.
  of the Book of Common Prayer</i>, 3rd edit., London, 1720, folio.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The following passage occurs in <i>A Letter to the Author of the
  Vindication of the Clergy</i>, by Dr. Eachard, London, 1705:</p>

  <p>I must content myself with giving the title of the following work, as
  I have never met with the book itself: <i>The Trojan Horse, or The
  Presbyterian Government Unbowelled</i>, London, 1646.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <i>Covenant</i>, to introduce that Government upon the Church of
  England."</p>

  <p>the second paragraph of the first page proceeds:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"But to see those very men who plead so vehemently against all kinds
  of tyranny, attempt to obtrude their own dreames not only upon their
  fellow-subjects, but upon their sovereigne himself, contrary to the
  dictates of his own conscience, contrary to all law of God and man; yea
  to compell forreigne churches to dance after their pipe, to worship that
  counterfeit image which they feign to have fallen down from Jupiter, and
  by force of arms to turne their neighbours out of a possession of above
  1400 years, to make roome for their <i>Trojan Horse</i> of ecclesiastical
  discipline (a practice never justified in the world but either by the
  Turk or by the Pope): this put us upon the defensive part. They must not
  think that other men are so cowed or grown so tame, as to stand still
  blowing of their noses, whilst they bridle them and ride them at their
  pleasure. It is time to let the world see that <i>this discipline</i>
  which they so much adore, is <i>the very quintessence of refined
  Popery</i>."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My copy of this tract has no place or date: but it appears to have
  been printed at the Hague in 1649. It was answered in the same year by
  "Robert Baylie, minister at Glasgow," whose reply was "printed at
  Delph."</p>

  <p>As the tide of the time and circumstance rolled on, this simile gained
  additional force and depth; and to understand the admirable aptitude of
  its application in the passage I shall next quote, a few preliminary
  remarks are necessary.</p>

  <p>There was always in the Church of England a portion of her members who
  could not forget that the Puritans, though external to her communion,
  were yet fellow Protestants; that they differed not in kind, but in
  degree&mdash;and that these differences were insignificant compared with
  those of Rome. At the same time, they reflected that perhaps the Church
  of England was not exactly in the middle, and that she would not lose
  were she to move a little nearer the Puritan side. Accordingly, various
  attempts were made to enlarge the terms of her communion, and eject from
  her service-book any lingering "relics of Popery" which might offend the
  weaker brethren yclept the Puritans: thus to make a grand Comprehension
  Creed&mdash;a Church to include all Protestants.</p>

  <p>This was tried in James I.'s reign at the Savoy Conference; but in
  spite of Baxter's strenuous efforts and model prayer-book, it was a
  failure. Even Archbishop Sancroft was led to attempt a similar
  Comprehensive Scheme, so terrified was he at the dominance of the Roman
  Church in the Second James's reign: however, William's accession, and his
  becoming a nonjuror, crossed his design. In 1689, Tillotson, Burnet, and
  a number of William's "Latitudinarian" clergy made a bold push for it. A
  Comprehension Bill actually passed the House of Lords, but was thrown out
  by the Commons and Convocation. From William's time toleration and
  encouragement were extended to all save "Popish Recusants;" so that there
  were a large number in the Church of England ready to assist their
  comrades <i>outside</i> in breaking down her fences. The High Churchmen,
  however, as may be guessed, would not sit tamely by, and see the leading
  idea of the Anglican Church thrown to the winds, her <i>via media</i>
  profaned, her park made a common, and her distinctive doctrines and
  fences levelled to the ground. What <i>their</i> feelings were, may be
  gathered from this indignant invective:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The most of the inconveniences we labour under to this day, owe their
  original to the weakness of some and to the cowardice of others of the
  clergy. For had they stood stiff and inflexible at first against the
  encroachments and intrigues of a Puritanical faction, like a threefold
  cord, we could not have been so easily shattered and broken. The
  dissenters, as well skilled in the art of war, have besieged the Church
  in form: and at all periods and seasons have raised their batteries, and
  carried on their saps and counter-scarps against her. They have left no
  means unessayed or practised, to weaken her. And when open violence has
  been baffled, and useless, <i>stratagem</i> and contrivance have supplied
  what force could never effect. Hence it is, that under the cant of
  <i>conscience</i> and <i>scruple</i>, they have feigned a compliance of
  embracing her communion; if such and such ceremonies and rules that then
  stood in force could be omitted, or connived at: and having once broke
  ground on her discipline, they have continued to carry on their trenches,
  and had almost brought the <i>Great Comprehension-Horse</i> within our
  walls; whilst the <i>complying</i>, or the <i>moderate</i> clergy (as
  they are called), like the infatuated <i>Trojans</i>, helped forward the
  <i>unwieldy machine</i>; nor were they aware of the danger and
  destruction that might have issued out of him."&mdash;<i>The

  <p>I shall but add a postscript to my former Note. In "N. &amp; Q." (Vol.

  <p>Dr. Eachard, in his work on <i>The Grounds and Occasions of the
  Contempt of the Clergy and Religion inquired into</i>, London, 1712,
  after ably showing up the pedantry of some preachers, next attacks the
  "indiscreet and horrid Metaphor Mongers." "Another thing that brings
  great disrespect and mischief upon the clergy ... is their packing their
  sermons so full of similitudes" (p. 41.). Eachard has a museum of
  curiosities in this line. <i>The Puritan Pulpit</i>, however, far
  outstrips even the incredible nonsense and irreverence which he adduces.
  Let any one curious in such matters dip into a collection of Scotch
  Sermons of the seventeenth century. Sir W. Scott, in some of his works,
  has endeavoured to give a faint idea of the extraordinary way in which
  passages of Holy Scripture were applied in the same century. I have a
  very curious <i>book of soliloquies</i>, which unfortunately wants the
  title-page. From internal evidence, however, it appeals to have been
  written in Ireland in the seventeenth century: the writer signs himself
  "P.&nbsp;P." The editor of this little 12mo., in "An Epistle to the Reader,"
  after reprehending "the wits of our times" for "quibbling and drolling
  upon the Bible," says immediately after:&mdash;"This author's <i>innocent
  abuse of Scripture</i> is so far from countenancing, that it rather
  shames and condemns that licentious and abominable practice. Nor can we
  admit of the most useful allusions without that harmless (nay helpful and
  advantageous) <span title="katachrÃªsis" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&alpha;&tau;&alpha;&chi;&rho;&eta;&sigma;&iota;&sigmaf;</span>,
  or abuse here practised: wherein the words are indeed used to another,
  but yet to a Holy end and purpose, besides that for which they were at
  first instituted and intended." The most reverend of our readers must
  need smile, were I to give a specimen of this "innocent abuse."</p>

  <p>While noticing the false wit which passed current in that century, we
  must not forget that the same age produced a South and a Butler: and that
  in beauty of simile, few, if any, surpass Bishop Jeremy Taylor.</p>

  <a name="footnote2"></a><b>Footnote 2:</b><a

  <p>An Analysis of the "divers pamphlets published against the Book of
  Common Prayer" would make a very curious volume. Take a passage from the
  <i>Anatomy of the Service Book</i>, for instance: "The cruellest of the
  American savages, called the Mohaukes, though they fattened their captive
  Christians to the slaughter, yet they eat them up at once; but the
  Service-book savages eat the servants of God by piece-meal: keeping them
  alive (if it may be called a life) <i>ut sentiant se mori</i>, that they
  may be the more sensible of their dying" (p. 56.). Sir Walter Scott
  quotes a curious tract in <i>Woodstock</i>, entitled <i>Vindication of
  the Book of Common Prayer against the Contumelious Slanders of the
  Fanatic Party terming it</i> "Porridge." The author of this singular and
  rare tract (says Sir W.) indulges in the allegorical style, till he
  fairly hunts down the allegory. The learned divine chases his metaphor at
  a very cold scent, through a pamphlet of his mortal quarto
  pages.&mdash;See a <i>Parallel of the Liturgy with the Mass Book,
  Breviary, &amp;c.</i>, by Robert Baylie. 1661, 4to.</p>

  <p>Let any one interested in the history of Comprehension refer to the
  proceedings relative to the formation of the "Evangelical Alliance."
  Jeremy Collier gives a curious parallel:&mdash;"Lord Burleigh, upon some
  complaint against the Liturgy, bade the Dissenters draw up another, and
  contrive the offices in such a form as might give general satisfaction to
  their brethren. Upon this overture the first classis struck out their
  lines, and drew mostly by the portrait of Geneva. This draught was
  referred to the consideration of a second classis, who made no less than
  <i>six hundred</i> exceptions to it. The third classis quarrelled with
  the corrections of the second, and declared for a new model. The fourth
  refined no less upon the third. The treasurer advised all these reviews,
  and different committees, on purpose to break their measures and silence
  their clamours against the Church. However, since they could not come to
  any agreement in a form for divine service, he had a handsome opportunity
  for a release: for now they could not decently importune him any farther.
  To part smoothly with them, he assured their agents that, when they came
  to any unanimous resolve upon the matter before them, they might expect
  his friendship, and that he should be ready to bring their scheme to a
  settlement." Collier's <i>Hist.</i>, vol. viii. p. 16. See Cardwell's
  <i>Hist. of the Conference connected with the Revision of the Book of
  Common Prayer</i>, London, 1849, 8vo. See also <i>Quarterly Review</i>,
  vol. 1. pp. 508-561., No. C. Jan. 1834. The present American Prayer Book
  is formed on the Comprehension scheme. Last year Pickering published a
  <i>Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England, adapted for General
  Use in other Protestant Churches</i>, which is well worth referring
  to.</p>

  <p>Those who wished to "comprehend" at the Roman side of the <i>via
  media</i> were very few. Elizabeth and Laud are the most prominent
  instances. Charles I., and afterwards the Nonjurors, had schemes of
  communion with the Greek Church. A <i>History of Comprehension</i> would
  involve a historical notice of the Thirty-nine Articles, and the plan of
  Comprehension maintained by some to be the intention of their framers. It
  should include also distinctive sketches of the classes formerly
  denominated <i>Church Papists</i> and <i>Church Puritans</i>.</p>

<h3>TESTIMONIALS TO DONKEYS.</h3>

  <p>The following extract from an article on "Angling in North Wales,"
  which appeared in <i>The Field</i> newspaper of October 22nd, contains a
  specimen of an entirely original kind of testimonial, which seems to me
  worthy of preservation in "N. &amp; Q.'s" museum of curiosities:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Beguiled by the treacherous representations of a certain Mr.
  Williams, and the high character of his donkeys, I undertook the ascent
  of Dunas Bran, and poked about among the ruins of Crow Castle on its
  summit, where I found nothing of any consequence, except an appetite for
  my dinner. The printed paper which Mr. Williams hands about, deploring
  the loss of his 'character,' and testifying to the wonderful superiority
  of all his animals, is rather amusing. Mr. Williams evidently never had a
  donkey 'what wouldn't go.' This paper commences with an affidavit from
  certain of the householders and <i>literati</i> of Llangollen, that he
  'had received numerous testimonials, all of which we are sorry to say
  <i>has</i> been lost.' Those preserved, however, and immortalised in
  print, suffice to establish Mr. Williams' reputation:</p>

  <p>"Mr. W. and his son and daughter bear testimony to the civility and
  attention of Mr. Williams <i>and</i> his donkeys.</p>

  <p>"S. P., Esquire, attended at the Haud Hotel, 24th June, 1851, and
  engaged four of Mr. Williams' donkeys for the use of a party of ladies,
  who expressed themselves highly gratified. The animals were remarkably
  tractable, and void of stupidity.</p>

  <p>"Mrs. D. A. B. visited Valle Crucis Abbey on the back of Mr. Williams'
  ass, and is well satisfied.</p>

  <p>Those who have visited Malvern will remember the vast quantity of
  donkeys who rejoice in the cognomen of "The Royal Moses." Their history
  is as follows:&mdash;When the late Queen Dowager was at Malvern, she
  frequently ascended the hills on donkey-back; and on all such occasions
  patronised a poor old woman, whose stud had been reduced, by a succession
  of misfortunes, to a solitary donkey, who answered to the name of
  "Moses." At the close of her visit, her majesty, with that kindness of
  heart which was such a distinguishing trait in her character, not only
  liberally rewarded the poor old woman, but asked her if there was
  anything that she could do for her which would be likely to bring back
  her former prosperity. The old woman turned the matter over in her mind,
  and then said, "Please your majesty to give a name to my donkey." This
  her Majesty did. "Moses" became "the Royal Moses;" every body wanted to
  ride him; the old woman's custom increased, and when the favoured animal
  died (for he is dead) he left behind him a numerous family, all of whom
  called after their father, "the Royal Moses."</p>

<h3>LONGEVITY IN CLEVELAND, YORKSHIRE.</h3>

  <p>A cursory conversation with a lady in her eighty-fifth year, now
  living at Skelton in Cleveland, in the North Riding of Yorkshire, when
  she <!-- Page 489 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page489"></a>{489}</span>deprecated the notion that she was one of
  the <i>old</i> inhabitants, led me to inquire more particularly into the
  duration of life in that township. The minister, the Rev. W. Close, who
  has been the incumbent since the year 1813, and who has had the duties to
  perform, and the registers to keep, therefore, from about the period of
  the act which required the age to be stated, now forty years ago, was
  most willing to give me aid and extracts from the burial register, from
  the commencement of 1813 to August, 1852, during which period 799 persons
  were buried. The extracts show these extraordinary facts.</p>

  <p>Out of the 799 persons buried in that period, no less than 263, or
  nearly one-third, attained the age of 70. Of these two, viz. Mary
  Postgate, who died in 1816, and Ann Stonehouse, who died in 1823,
  attained respectively the ages of 101. Nineteen others were 90 years of
  age and upwards, viz. one was 97, one was 96, one was 95, four were 94,
  one was 93, five were 92, three were 91, and three were 90. Between the
  ages of 80 and 90 there died 109, of whom thirty-nine were 85 and
  upwards, and seventy were under 85; and between the ages of 70 and 80
  there died 133, of whom sixty-five were 75 years and upwards, and
  sixty-eight were between 70 and 75. In one page of the register
  containing eight names, six were above 80, and in another five were above
  70.</p>

  <p>In this parish of Skelton there is now living a man named Moon, 104
  years old, who is blind now, but managed a small farm till nearly or
  quite 100; and a blacksmith named Robinson Cook, aged 98, who worked at
  his trade till May last.</p>

  <p>In the chapelry of Brotton, which adjoins Skelton township, and has
  been also under the spiritual charge of Mr. Close, the longevity is even
  more remarkable. Out of 346 persons buried since the new register came
  into force in 1813, down to 1st October, 1853, no less than 121, or more
  than one-third, attained the age of 70. One Betty Thompson, who died in
  1834, was 101; nineteen were more than 90, of whom one was 98, two were
  97, three were 95, one was 93, four were 92, five were 91, and three were
  90; there were forty-four who died between 80 and 90 years old, of whom
  nineteen were 85 and upwards, and twenty-five were between 80 and 85; and
  there were fifty-seven who died between the ages of 70 and 80, of whom no
  less than thirty-one were 75 and upwards. The average of the chapelry is
  increased from the circumstance that sixteen bodies of persons drowned in
  the sea in wrecks, and whose ages were not of course very great, are
  included in the whole number of 346 burials. That celibacy did not lessen
  the chance of life, was proved by a bachelor named Simpson, who died at
  92, and his maiden sister at 91.</p>

  <p>I am told that the neighbouring parish of Upleatham has also a high
  character for longevity, but I had not the same opportunity of examining
  the register as was afforded me by Mr. Close.</p>

  <p>And now for a Query. What other, if any district in the north or
  south, will show like or greater longevity?</p>

<h3>REV. JOSIAH PULLEN.</h3>

  <p>Every Oxford man regards with some degree of interest that goal of so
  many of his walks, Joe Pullen's tree, on Headington Hill. So at least it
  was in my time, now some thirty years since. Perhaps the following
  notices of him, who I suppose planted it, or at all events gave name to
  it, may be acceptable to your Oxford readers. They are taken from that
  most curious collection (alas! too little known) the Pocket-books of Tom
  Hearne, vol. liii. pp. 25-35., now in the Bodleian:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Jan. 1, 1714-15. Last night died Mr. Josiah Pullen, A.M., minister of
  St. Peter's in the East, and Vice-Principal of Magdalen Hall. He had also
  a parsonage in the country. He was formerly domestick chaplain to Bishop
  Sanderson, to whom he administered the sacrament at his death. He lived
  to a very great age, being about fourscore and three, and was always very
  healthy and vigorous. He was regular in his way of living, but too close,
  considering that he was a single man, and was wealthy. He seldom used
  spectacles, which made him guilty of great blunders at divine service,
  for he would officiate to the last. He administered the Sacrament last
  Christmas Day to a great congregation at St. Peter's, which brought his
  illness upon him. He took his B.A. degree May 26, 1654. He became
  minister of St. Peter's in the East anno 1668, which was the year before
  Dr. Charlett was entered at Oxford."&mdash;P. 25.</p>

  <p>"Jan. 7, Friday. This day, at four in the afternoon, Mr. Pullen was
  buried in St. Peter's Church, in the chapel at the north side of the
  chancell. All the parishioners were invited, and the pall was held up by
  six Heads of Houses, though it should have been by six Masters of Arts,
  as Dr. Radcliffe's pall should have been held up by Doctors in Physic,
  and not by Doctors of Divinity and Doctors of Law."&mdash;P. 32.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Dr. Radcliffe's funeral had taken place in the preceding month.</p>

  <p>In Nichols's <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. iv. p. 181., is the
  following epitaph of Pullen, drawn up by Mr. Thomas Wagstaffe:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Hic jacet reverendus vir Josia Pullen, A.M. AulÃ¦ Magd. 57 annos vice
  principalis, necnon hujusce ecclesiÃ¦ Pastor 39 annos. Obiit
  31<sup>o</sup> Decembris, anno Domini 1714, Ã¦tatis 84."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From the notice of Thomas Walden, in Johnson's <i>Lives of the
  Poets</i>, it appears that Yalden was a pupil of Pullen. (See also
  Walton's <i>Life of Sanderson</i>, towards the end.) I hope this may
  elicit some farther account of a man whose name has survived so long in
  Oxford memory. <!-- Page 490 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page490"></a>{490}</span></p>

  <p>As to the tree, I have some recollection of having heard that it had a
  few years ago a narrow escape of being thrown down, sometime about the
  vice-chancellorship of Dr. Symons, who promptly came forward to the
  rescue. Was it ever in such peril? and, if so, was it preserved?</p>

<h3>FOLK LORE.</h3>

  <p><i>Ancient Custom in Warwickshire.</i>&mdash;In Sir William Dugdale's
  <i>Diary</i>, under the year 1658, is noted the following:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"On All Hallow Even, the master of the family antiently used to carry
  a bunch of straw, fired, about his corne, saying,</p>

  <div class="poem">

      <p class="hg1">'Fire and red low,</p>
      <p>Light on my teen low.'"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Can any of your readers learned in ancient lore explain the custom and
  the meaning of the couplet, well as its origin? Does it now at all
  prevail in that county?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">J. B. Whitborne.</span></p>

  <p><i>Nottinghamshire Customs.</i>&mdash;1. The 29th of May is observed
  by the Notts juveniles not only by wearing the usual piece of oak-twig,
  but each young loyalist is armed with a nettle, as coarse as can be
  procured, with which instrument of torture are coerced those unfortunates
  who are unprovided with "royal oak," as it is called. Some who are unable
  to procure it endeavour to avoid the penalty by wearing "dog-oak"
  (maple), but the punishment is always more severe on discovery of the
  imposition.</p>

  <p>2. On Shrove Tuesday, the first pancake cooked is given to Chanticleer
  for his sole gratification.</p>

  <p>3. The following matrimonial custom prevails at Wellow or Welley, as
  it is called, a village in the heart of the county. The account is copied
  from the <i>Notts Guardian</i> of April 28, 1853:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Wellow. It has been a custom from time immemorial in this parish,
  when the banns of marriage are published, for a person, selected by the
  clerk, to rise and say 'God speed them well,' the clerk and congregation

  in this ceremony, last Sunday, after the banns of marriage were read, a
  perfect silence prevailed, the person chosen, either from want of courage
  or loss of memory, not performing his part until after receiving an
  intimation from the clerk, and then in so faint a tone as to be scarcely
  audible. His whispered good wishes were, however, followed by a hearty
  Amen, mingled with some laughter in different parts of the church."</p>

  <p><i>A Centenarian Couple.</i>&mdash;The obituary of <i>Blackwood's

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Lately, in Campbell, County Virginia, Mr. Chas. Layne, sen., aged 121
  years, being born at Albemarle, near Buckingham county, 1700. He has left
  a widow aged 110 years, and a numerous and respectable family down to the
  fourth generation. He was a subject of four British sovereigns, and a
  citizen of the United States for nearly forty-eight years. Until within a
  few years he enjoyed all his faculties, and excellent health."</p>

  <p><i>Rome and the Number Six.</i>&mdash;It has been remarked lately in
  "N. &amp; Q." that in English history, the reign of the second sovereign
  of the same name has been infelicitous. I cannot turn to the <!-- Page
  491 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page491"></a>{491}</span>note I
  read, and I forget whether it noticed the remarks in Aubrey's
  <i>Miscellanies</i> (London, 8vo., 1696), that "all the <i>second</i>
  kings since the Conquest have been unfortunate." It may be worth the
  while to add (what is remarked by Mr. Matthews in his <i>Diary of an
  Invalid</i>), that the number <i>six</i> has been considered at Rome as
  ominous of misfortune. Tarquinius Sextus was the very worst of the
  Tarquins, and his brutal conduct led to a revolution in the government;
  under Urban the Sixth, the great schism of the West broke out; Alexander
  the Sixth outdid all that his predecessors amongst the Tarquins or the
  Popes had ventured to do before him; and the presentiment seemed to
  receive confirmation in the misfortunes of the reign of his successor
  Pius VI., to whose election was applied the line:</p>

  <p><i>Zend Grammar.</i>&mdash;The following fragment on Zend grammar
  having fallen in my way, I inclose you a copy, as the remarks contained
  in it may be of service to Oriental scholars.</p>

  <p>I am unable to state the author's name, although I suspect the MS. to
  be from a highly important quarter. The subject-matter, however, is
  sufficiently important to merit publication.</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The <i>Zend</i>, of disputed authenticity, and the <i>Asmani
  Zuban</i>, a notoriously fictitious tongue, compared."</p>

  <p>"It is well known that Sanscrit words abound in <i>Zend</i>; and that
  some of its inflexions are formed by the rules of the Vyacaran or
  <i>Sanscrit</i> grammar.</p>

  <p>"It would therefore seem quite possible that by application of these
  rules a grammar might be written of the <i>Zend</i>. Would such a
  composition afford any proof of the disputed point&mdash;the authenticity
  of the <i>Zend</i>?</p>

  <p>"I think it would not, and support my opinion by reasons founded on
  the following facts.</p>

  <p>"The <i>Asmani Zuban</i> of the DesstÃ¹ is most intimately allied to
  Persian. It is, in fact, fabricated out of that language, as is shown by
  clear internal evidence. Now the grammatical structure of this fictitious
  tongue is identical with that of Persian: and hence by following the
  rules of Persian grammar, a grammar of the <i>Asmani Zuban</i> might be
  easily framed. But would this work advance the cause of forgery, and tend
  to invest it with the quality of truth? No more, I answer, and for the
  same reason, than is a grammar of the <i>Zend</i>, founded on the
  Vyacaran, to be received in proof of the authenticity of that
  language."</p>

  <p><i>The Duke's first Victory.</i>&mdash;Perhaps it may interest the
  future author of the life of the Duke of Wellington to be informed of his
  <i>first victory</i>. It was not in India, as commonly supposed, but on
  Donnybrook Road, near Dublin, that his first laurels were won. This
  appears from the <i>Freeman's Journal</i>, September 18th, 1789, where we
  learn that in consequence of a wager between him and Mr. Whaley of 150
  guineas, the Hon. Arthur Wesley walked from the five-mile stone on
  Donnybrook Road to the corner of the circular road in Leeson Street, in
  fifty-five minutes, and that a number of gentlemen rode with the walker,
  whose horses he kept in a tolerable smart trot. When it is recollected
  that those were Irish miles, even deducting the distance from Leeson
  Street to the Castle, whence the original measurements were made, this
  walk must be computed at nearly six English miles.</p>

  <p><i>Straw Paper.</i>&mdash;Various papers manufactured of straw are now
  in the market. The pen moves so easily over any and all of them, that
  literary men should give them a trial. As there seems considerable
  likelihood of this manufacture being extensively introduced, on account
  of the dearness of rags, &amp;c., it is to be hoped that it will not be
  <i>improved</i> into the resemblance of ordinary paper. Time was when
  ordinary paper could be written on in comfort, but that which adulterated
  Falstaff's sack spoiled it for the purpose, and converted it into limed
  twigs to catch the winged pen.</p>

<h2>Queries.</h2>

<h3>LAURIE (?) ON CURRENCY, ETC.</h3>

  <p>I have before me a bulky volume, apparently unpublished, treating of
  currency and of many other politico-economical affairs; the authorship of
  which I am desirous of tracing. If any reader of "N. &amp; Q." can assist
  my search I shall feel greatly obliged to him.</p>

  <p>This volume extends to 936 closely printed pages, and is altogether
  without divisions either of book, chapter, or section. It has neither
  title-page, conclusion, imprint, or date; and my copy seems to consist of
  revises or "clean sheets" as they came from the press. The main gist of
  the work is thus described, apparently by the author himself, in a MS.
  note which occupies the place of the title-page:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"It is here meant to show that in civilised nations money is an
  emanating circulable wealth and power, <!-- Page 492 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page492"></a>{492}</span>without which
  individuals cannot go on in improvement on independent principles. It
  resolves wealth into the forms most conducive to this object, and
  prepares for the highest services both individuals and communities."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The book, however, is extremely discursive, and no small portion of it
  is devoted to foreign politics. Thus, of the "Eastern Question," the
  author disposes in this fashion:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Austria, to answer its destination, ought to comprise Wallachia,
  Bessarabia, Moldavia, and, following the line of demarcation drawn by the
  Danube, the whole territory at its debouchment.... Turkey cannot regard
  the sacrifices proposed as of much importance, when such security as that
  now in contemplation could be obtained. The whole strength of her immense
  empire is at present drained to support her contest on this very barrier
  with Russia. But that barrier, it is evident, would this way be
  effectually secured: for Austria has too many points of importance to
  protect, to dream of creating new ones on this feeble yet extended
  confine of her domains."&mdash;Pp. 835, 836.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>From internal evidence, the book appears to have been written between
  1812 and 1815. It is printed in half-sheets, from sig. A to sig. 6 B, and
  three half-sheets are wanting, viz. E, 5 Q, and 5 R. In place of the last
  two, the following MS. note is inserted:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The speculations in the two following sheets included views that
  related to the disorganised state of Turkey, and the unhappy dependence
  of the Bourbon family; which are now, from the changes which have taken
  place, altogether unfit for publication."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The sole indication of the authorship which I have observed throughout
  the volume lies in the following foot-note, at p. 893.:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"This is all that seems to be necessary to say on the subject of
  education. In a treatise published by me a few years ago, entitled
  <i>Improvements in Glasgow</i>, I think I have exhausted," &amp;c.<a
  name="footnotetag6" href="#footnote6"><sup>[6]</sup></a></p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The only treatise with such a title which I find in Watt's
  <i>Bibliotheca Britannica</i> is thus entered:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<span class="sc">Laurie</span>, David. Proposed improvements in
  Glasgow. Glasg., 1810, 8vo.&mdash;Hints regarding the East India
  Monopoly, 1813. 2<i>s.</i>"</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>My <i>Queries</i> then are these:</p>

  <p>1. Is anything known of such a treatise on "circulable wealth,"
  &amp;c., as that which I have named?</p>

  <p>2. Is any biographical notice extant of the "David Laurie" mentioned
  by Watt?</p>

  <p>I may add that the volume in question was recently purchased along
  with about 1000 other pamphlets and books, chiefly on political economy:
  all of which appear to have formerly belonged to the late Lord Bexley,
  and to have been for the most part collected by him when Chancellor of
  the Exchequer.</p>

  mentioned in Mr. M<sup>c</sup>Culloch's <i>Literature of Political

<h3>"DONATUS REDIVIVUS."</h3>

  <p>Can you, or any of your correspondents, give me any information
  relative to the history or authorship of the following
  pamphlet?&mdash;</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Donatus Redivivus: or a Reprimand to a modern Church-Schismatick, for
  his Revival of the Donatistical Heresy of Rebaptization, in Defiance to
  the Judgment and Practice of the Catholick Church, and of the Church of
  England in particular. In a Letter to Himself. London, 1714."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The same tract (precisely identical, except in the title-page) is also
  to be found with the following title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Rebaptization condemned. Wherein is shown, 1. That to Rebaptize any
  Person that was once Baptiz'd, even by Laymen, in the name of the Sacred
  Trinity, is contrary to the Practice of the Catholick Church in all Ages.
  2. That it is repugnant to the Principles and Practice of the Church of
  England. 3. The Pernicious Consequences of such a Practice. By the Author
  of Plain Dealing, or Separation without Schism," &amp;c. London,
  1716.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>I am aware that, according to Dr. Watt, the author of <i>Plain
  Dealing</i> was Charles Owen, D.D., but he makes no mention of <i>Donatus
  Redivivus</i>, and I am unable to discover any account of Dr. Charles
  Owen or his writings elsewhere. There appears to have been a reply to
  <i>Donatus Redivivus</i>, purporting to be from the pen of a Mrs. Jane
  Chorlton. This I have never seen, and have only learned of its existence
  from a subsequent pamphlet with the following title:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The Amazon Disarm'd: or, the Sophisms of a Schismatical Pamphlet,
  pretendedly writ by a Gentlewoman, entituled An Answer to Donatus
  Redivivus, exposed and confuted; being a further Vindication of the
  Church of England from the scandalous imputation of Donatism or
  Rebaptization. London, 1714."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The dedication of this last tract begins as follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

<p class="cenhead">"To the Reverend Mr. L&mdash;ter, and the Demi-reverend Mr. M&mdash;l&mdash;n.</p>

  <p>"Gentlemen,</p>

  <p>"This letter belongs to you upon a double account, as you were the
  chief Actors in the late Rebaptizaton, and are the supposed Vindicators
  of it, in the Answer to Donatus: a Treatise writ in Defence of the
  Sentiments of the Church, which you father upon a Dissenting Minister,
  and disingenuously point out to Mr. O&mdash;&mdash;n by Name,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The point which I wish particularly to ascertain is, whether Dr.
  Charles Owen was really the <!-- Page 493 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page493"></a>{493}</span>author of either of the tracts I have
  mentioned; and if so, who he was, and where I can find an account of him

  <p><i>Encaustic Tiles from Caen.</i>&mdash;In the town of Caen, in
  Normandy, is an ancient Gothic building standing in the grounds of the
  ancient convent of the Benedictines, now used as a college. This
  building, which is commonly known as the "Salle des Gardes de Guillaume
  le Conquerant," was many years ago paved with glazed emblazoned
  earthenware tiles, which were of the dimensions of about five inches
  square, and one and a quarter thick; the subjects of them are said to be
  the arms of some of the chiefs who accompanied William the Conqueror to
  England. Some antiquaries said these tiles were of the age of William I.;
  others that they could only date from Edward III. I find it stated in the
  <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> for March, 1789, vol. lix. p. 211., that
  twenty of the tiles above spoken of were taken up by the Benedictine
  monks, and sent as a present to Charles Chadwick, Esq., Healey Hall,
  Lancashire, in 1786. The rest of the tiles were destroyed by the
  revolutionists, with the exception of some which were fortunately saved
  by the AbbÃ© de la Rue and M.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;A. Lair, of Caen. What I wish to inquire
  is, firstly, who was Charles Chadwick, Esq.? and secondly, supposing that
  he is no longer living, which I think from the lapse of time will be most
  probable, does any one know what became of the tiles which he had
  received from France in 1786?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">George Boase.</span></p>

  <p>P.S.&mdash;The <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i> gives a plate of these

  first used. I have found one mentioned in a conveyance dated 1642, but
  they were much earlier. Any information on the history of the drainage of

  French historian Froissart, four knights or esquires, whose names he does
  not supply, attended the brave Lord Audley at the memorable battle of
  Poictiers, who, some English historians say, were Sir John Delves of
  Doddington, Sir Thomas Dutton of Dutton, Sir Robert Fowlehurst of Crewe
  (all these places being in Cheshire), and Sir John Hawkstone of Wrinehill
  in Staffordshire; whilst others name Sir James de Mackworth of Mackworth
  in Derbyshire, and Sir Richard de Tunstall <i>alias</i> Sneyde of
  Tunstall in Staffordshire, as <i>two of such knights or esquires</i>. The
  accuracy of Froissart as an historian has never been questioned; and as
  he expressly names only <i>four</i> attendants on Lord Audley at the
  battle of Poictiers, it is extremely desirable it should be ascertained
  if possible which of the six above-named knights really were the
  companions of Lord Audley Froissart alludes to; and probably some of your

<h2>Minor Queries with Answers.</h2>

  <p><i>"Vox Populi Vox Dei."</i>&mdash;Lieber, in the last chapter of his
  <i>Civil Liberty</i>, treating of this dictum, ascribes its origin to the
  Middle Ages, acknowledging, however, that he is unable to give anything
  very definite. Sir William Hamilton, in his edition of the <i>Works</i>
  of Thomas Reid, gives the concluding words of Hesiod's <i>Works and
  Days</i> thus:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"The word proclaimed by the concordant voice of mankind fails not; for
  in man speaks God."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>And to this the great philosopher adds:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Hence the adage (?), 'Vox Populi vox Dei.'"</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>The sign of interrogation is Sir William Hamilton's, and he was right
  to put it; for whatever the psychological connexion between Hesiod's
  dictum and V.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;D. may be, there is surely no historical. "Vox Populi
  vox Dei" is a different concept, breathing the spirit of a different
  age.</p>

  <p>How far back, then, can the dictum in these very words be traced?</p>

  <p>Does it, as Lieber says, originally belong to the election of bishops
  by the people?</p>

  <p>Or was it of Crusade origin?</p>

  <p>America begs Europe to give her facts, not speculation, and hopes that
  Europe will be good enough to comply with her request. Europe has given
  the serious "V.&nbsp;P.&nbsp;V.&nbsp;D." to America, so she may as well give its history
  to America too.</p>

  although the subject has already been discussed in our columns. The

  <p><i>"Lanquettes Cronicles."</i>&mdash;Of what date is the earliest
  printed copy of these Chronicles? The oldest I am acquainted with is
  1560, in quarto (continued up to 1540 by Bishop Cooper). Is this edition
  rare?</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">R. C. Warde.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Kidderminster.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[The earliest edition is that printed by T. Berthelet, 4to., 1549. The
  first two parts of this Chronicle, <!-- Page 495 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page495"></a>{495}</span>and the beginning of
  the third, as far as the seventeenth year after Christ, were composed by
  Thomas Lanquet, a young man of twenty-four years of age. Owing to his
  early death, Bishop Cooper finished the work; and his part, which is the
  third, contains almost thrice as much as Lanquet's two parts, being taken
  from Achilles Pyrminius. When it was finished, a surreptitious edition
  appeared in 1559, under the title of Lanquet's <i>Chronicle</i>; hereupon
  the bishop protested against "the vnhonest dealynge" of this book, edited
  by Thomas Crowley, in the next edition, entitled Cooper's
  <i>Chronicle</i>, "printed in the house late Thomas Berthelettes," 1560.
  The running title to the first and second parts is, "Lanquet's
  Chronicle;" and to the third, "The Epitome of Chronicles." The other
  editions are, "London, 1554," 4to., and "London, 1565," 4to. We should
  think the edition of 1560 rare: it was in the collections of Mr. Heber
  and Mr. Herbert. In this work the following memorable passage occurs,
  under the year 1542:&mdash;"One named Johannes Faustius fyrste founde the
  crafte of printynge in the citee of Mens in Germanie."]</p>

  <p><i>"Our English Milo."</i>&mdash;Bishop Hall extols in his <i>Heaven

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">R. C. Warde.</span></p>

  <p class="address">Kidderminster.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[If we may offer a conjecture, in the passage cited the bishop seems
  to refer to that "greatest scourge of Spain" Sir Walter Raleigh, and not
  so much to a bull-fight as to the Spanish Armada. The bishop is
  prescribing Expectation as a remedy for Crosses, and says, "Is it not
  credible what a fore-resolved mind can do&mdash;can suffer? Could our
  English Milo, of whom Spain yet speaketh, since their last peace, have
  overthrown that furious beast, made now more violent through the rage of
  his baiting, if he had not settled himself in his station, and expected?"
  Sir Walter's "fore-resolved and expectant mind" was shown in the
  publication of his treatise, <i>Notes of Directions for the Defence of
  the Kingdom</i>, written three years before the Spanish invasion of
  1588.]</p>

  by Stradling, and another by Dunbar, a Scot," I have met with one
  allusion to him among the epigrams of T. Bancroft, 4to., Lond. 1639,

<h3>"PINECE WITH A STINK."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 270. 350.)</p>

  <p>I would not have meddled with this subject if R.&nbsp;G., getting on a
  wrong scent, had not arrived at the very extraordinary conclusion that
  Bramhall meant a "pinnace," and an "offensive composition well known to
  sailors!"</p>

  <p>The earliest notice that I have met with of the <i>pinece</i> in an
  English work, is in the second part of the <i>Secrets of Maister Alexis
  of Piemont</i>, translated by W. Warde, Lond. 1568. There I find the
  following secrets&mdash;worth knowing, too, if effective:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"<i>Against stinking vermin called Punesies.</i>&mdash;If you rub your
  bedsteede with squilla stamped with vinaigre, or with the leaves of cedar
  tree sodden in oil, you shall never feel punese. Also if you set under
  the bed a payle full of water the puneses will not trouble you at
  all."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Butler, in the first canto of the third part of <i>Hudibras</i>, also
  mentions it thus:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And stole his talismanic louse&mdash;</p>
      <p>His flea, his morpion, and punaise."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>If the Querist refers to his French dictionary he will soon discover
  the meaning of <i>morpion</i> and <i>punaise</i>&mdash;the latter without
  doubt the <i>pinece</i> of Bishop Bramhall. Cotgrave, in his
  <i>French-English Dictionary</i>, London, 1650, defines <i>punaise</i> to
  be "the noysome and stinking vermin called the bed punie."</p>

  <p>It may be bad taste to dwell any longer on this subject; but as it
  illustrates a curious fact in natural history, and as it has been well
  said, that whatever the Almighty has thought proper to create is not
  beneath the study of mankind, I shall crave a word or two more.</p>

  <p>The <i>pinece</i> is not originally a native of this country; and that
  is the reason why, so many years after its first appearance in England,
  it was known only by a corruption of its French name <i>punaise</i>, or
  its German appellation <i>wandlaus</i> (wall-louse). Penny, a celebrated
  physician and naturalist in the reign of Henry VII., discovered it at
  Mortlake in rather a curious manner. Mouffet, in his <i>Theatrum
  Insectorum</i> (Lond. 1634), thus relates the story:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Anno 1503, dum hÃ¦c Pennio scriptitaret, Mortlacum Tamesin adjacentem
  viculum, magna festinatione accersebatur ad duas nobiles, magno metu ex
  cimicum vestigiis percussas, et quid nescio contagionis valde veritas.
  Tandem recognita, ac bestiolis captis, risu timorem omnem excussat."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Mouffet also tells us that in his time the insect was little known in
  England, though very common on the Continent, a circumstance which he
  ascribes to the superior cleanliness of the English:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Munditiem frequentemque lectulorum et culcitrarem lotionem, cum
  Galli, Germani, et Itali minus curant, pariunt magis hane pestem, Angli
  autem munditei et cultus studiosissimi rarius iis laborant."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Ray, in his <i>Historia Insectorum</i>, published in 1710, merely
  terms it the <i>punice</i> or wall-louse; indeed, I am not aware that the
  modern name of the insect appears in print previous to 1730, when one
  Southal published <i>A Treatise of Buggs</i>. Southal appears to have
  been an illiterate person; and he erroneously ascribes the introduction
  of the insect into this country to the large quantities of foreign fir
  used to rebuild London after the Great Fire.</p>

  <p>The word <i>bug</i>, signifying a frightful object or spectre, derived
  from the Celtic and the root of <i>bogie</i>, bug-aboo, bug-bear&mdash;is
  well known in our earlier literature. Spenser, Shakspeare, Milton,
  Beaumont and Fletcher, Holinshed and many others, use it; and in
  Matthew's <i>Bible</i>, the fifth verse of the ninety-first psalm is
  rendered:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Thou shalt not nede to be afraid of any bugs by night."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>Thus we see that a real "terror of the night" in course of time,
  assumed, by common consent, the title of the imaginary evil spirit of our
  ancestors.</p>

  <p>One word more. I can see no difficulty in tracing the derivation of
  the word <i>humbug</i>, without going to Hamburg, Hume of the Bog, or any
  such distant sources. In Grose's <i>Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue</i>,
  I find the word <i>hum</i> signifying deceive. Peter Pindar, too, writes
  writes:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Full many a trope from bayonet and drum</p>
      <p>He threaten'd but behold! 'twas all a hum."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Now, the rustic who frightens his neighbour with a turnip lanthorn and
  a white sheet, or the spirit-rapping medium, who, for a consideration,
  treats his verdant client with a communication from the unseen world,
  most decidedly humbugs him; that is, hums or deceives him with an
  imaginary spirit, or bug.</p>

  <p class="address">Ham.</p>

  <p>I take it that the editor of Archbishop Bramhall's <i>Works</i> was
  judicious in not altering the <!-- Page 497 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page497"></a>{497}</span>word <i>pinece</i> to <i>pinnace</i>, as
  an object very different from the latter was meant; <i>i. e.</i> a
  <i>cimex</i>, who certainly <i>revenges</i> any attack upon his person
  with a <i>stink</i>. <i>Pinece</i> is only a mistaken orthography of
  <i>punese</i>, the old English name of the obnoxious insect our
  neighbours still call a <i>punaise</i> (see Cotgrave <i>in voce</i>).
  Florio says "Cimici, a kinde of vermine in Italie that breedeth in beds
  and biteth sore, called punies or wall-lice." We have it in fitting
  company in <i>Hudibras</i>, <span class="scac">III</span>. 1.:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"And stole his talismanic louse,</p>
      <p>His flea, his morpion, and punese."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>This is only one more instance of the danger of altering the
  orthography, or changing an obsolete word, the meaning of which is not
  immediately obvious. The substitution of <i>pinnace</i> would have been
  entirely to depart from the meaning of the Archbishop.</p>

<h3>MONUMENTAL BRASSES ABROAD.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. vi., p. 167.)</p>

  <p>A recent visit to the cathedral of Aix-la-Chapelle enables me to add
  the following Notes to the list already published in "N. &amp; Q."</p>

  <p>The brasses are five in number, and are all contained in a chapel on
  the north-west side of the dome:</p>

  <p>1. Arnoldus de Meroide, 1487, is a mural, rectangular plate (3' Â· 10"
  Ã 2' Â· 4"), on the upper half of which are engraved the Virgin and Child,
  to whom an angel presents a kneeling priest, and St. Bartholomew with
  knife and book.</p>

  <p>2. Johannes Pollart, 1534, is also mural and rectangular (5' Â· 2Â½" Ã
  2' Â· 4"), but is broken into two unequal portions, now placed side by
  side. The upper half of the larger piece has the following
  engraving:&mdash;In the centre stands the Virgin, wearing an arched
  imperial crown. Angels swing censers above her head. St. John Baptist, on
  her right hand, presents a kneeling priest in surplice and alb; and St.
  Christopher bears "the mysterious Child" on her left. The lower half
  contains part of the long inscription which is completed on the smaller
  detached piece.</p>

  <p>3. Johannes et Lambertus Munten, 1546. This is likewise mural and
  rectangular (2' Â· 11Â½" Ã 2' Â· 1"). It is <i>painted</i> a deep blue
  colour, and has an inscription in gilt letters, at the foot of which is
  depicted an emaciated figure, wrapped in a shroud and lying upon an
  altar-tomb: large worms creep round the head and feet.</p>

  <p>4. Johannes Paiel, 1560. Mural, rectangular (3' Â· 4" Ã 2' Â· 4Â¼"). This
  is <i>painted</i> as the last-mentioned plate, and represents the Virgin
  and Child in a flaming aureole. Her feet rest in a crescent, around which
  is twisted a serpent; on her right hand stand St. John Baptist and the
  Holy Lamb, each bearing a cross; and to her left is St. Mary Magdalene,
  who presents a kneeling priest.</p>

  <p>5. Henricus de .... This <span class="correction" title="Original reads `in'."
  >is</span> on the floor in front of the altar-rails, and consists of a
  rectangular plate (2' Â· 9" Ã 2' Â· 1"), on which is represented an angel
  wearing a surplice and a stole semÃ©e of crosses fitcheÃ©, and supporting a
  shield bearing three fleurs-de-lis, with as many crosses fitchÃ©e. A
  partially-effaced inscription runs round the plate, within a floriated
  margin, and with evangelistic symbols at the corners.</p>

  <p>In the centre of the choir of Cologne Cathedral lies a <i>modern</i>
  rectangular brass plate (8' Â· 10" Ã 3' Â· 11") to the memory of a late
  archbishop, Ferdinandus Augustus, 1835.</p>

  <p>Beneath a single canopy is a full-length picture of the archbishop in
  eucharistic vestments (the stole unusually short), a pall over his
  shoulders, and an elaborate pastoral staff in his hand.</p>

<h3>MILTON'S "LYCIDAS."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. ii., p. 246.; Vol. vi., p. 143.)</p>

  <p>Your correspondent <span class="sc">Jarltzberg</span>, at the first
  reference, asks for the sense of the passage,&mdash;</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Besides what the grim wolf with privy paw</p>
      <p>Daily devours apace, and nothing sed:</p>
      <p>But that two-handed engine at the door</p>
      <p>Stands ready to smite once, and smite no more."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>My own view of this passage strongly testifies against the
  interpretation of another passage at the second reference.</p>

  <p>The <i>two-handed engine</i>, I am positive, is St. Michael's sword.
  Farther on in the poem the bard addresses the angel St. Michael
  (according to Warton), who is conceived as guarding the Mount from
  enemies with a drawn sword, for in this form I apprehend does tradition
  state the vision to have been seen; and he bids him to desist from
  looking out for enemies towards the coast of Spain, and to "look
  homeward," at one of his own shepherds who is being washed ashore, in all
  probability upon this very promontory. Milton elsewhere (<i>Par.
  Lost</i>, book vi. 251.) speaks of the "huge two-handed sway" of this
  sword of St. Michael; and here, in <i>Lycidas</i> he repeats the epithet
  to identify the instrument which is to accomplish the destruction of the
  wolf. St. Michael's sword is to smite off the head of Satan, who at the
  door of Christ's fold is, "with privy paw," daily devouring the hungry
  sheep. Note here that, according to some theologians, the archangel
  Michael, in prophecy, means Christ himself. (See the authorities quoted
  by Heber, <i>Bampton Lectures</i>, iv. note <i>l</i>, p. 242.) Hence it
  is His business to preserve <i>His own</i> sheep. In the Apocalypse the
  final blow of St. Michael's (or Christ's) two-edged sword, which <!--
  Page 498 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page498"></a>{498}</span>is to
  cleave the serpent's head, is made a distinct subject of prophecy. (See
  Rev. xii. 7-10.)</p>

  <p>While on this subject allow me to ask, Can a dolphin waft? Can a shore
  wash?</p>

<h3>SCHOOL LIBRARIES.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., pp. 220. 395.)</p>

  <p>In returning thanks to those of your correspondents who replied to my
  Query, I ought, perhaps, to have begged to learn such of our public
  schools that were <i>without</i> libraries, as the best means of
  obtaining for them bequests or gifts that would form a nucleus of a good
  library. For example, a correspondent informs me that the governors of
  Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Wimborne, Dorset, are laying by
  10<i>l.</i> a year towards the purchase of books for that purpose: that
  having no library at present, there now is a favourable opportunity for
  either a gift or a bequest: but I should in any case prefer a selection
  of works likely to prove readable for young people, as history,
  biography, travels, and the popular works of science.</p>

  <p>I can quite imagine that Eton, Winchester, Westminster, Harrow,
  Shrewsbury, and other similar great schools, would have such libraries,
  but these are not half the number of our public foundations; the wealthy
  schools above mentioned, and the rich men's children who go to them,
  would be in a sad plight indeed were they not amply provided for in such
  matters. But there are others whose mission is not less important,
  perhaps more so; and on this head none would be better pleased than I to
  find I laboured under an "erroneous impression," as remarked by <span
  class="sc">Etonensis</span>. The English public appeared to have an
  "erroneous impression" that they were better provided with books than any
  other people a short time ago, till it was disproved when the agitation
  respecting parochial libraries was set on foot, the facts appearing on
  the institution of the Marylebone public library.</p>

  <p>It has been shown that in France and Germany the public libraries, and
  the volumes in them, far exceed any that we possess; a strange fact, when
  we are better provided with standard authors than any other language in
  the world. I should much wish these brief parallels answered. The city of
  Lyons has a magnificent public library of 100,000 vols., open to all; how
  many has her rival Manchester? Boulogne has a public library of 16,000
  vols.; how many has Southampton? From the obliging notices of
  correspondents in "N. &amp; Q.," we have had several articles on
  parochial libraries, and the sum of the whole appears to be most
  miserable; surely some bad system has prevailed either in not having
  proper places for them, or in some other fault. In one place the resident
  clergyman sells them: surely if they were combined under some enlarged
  plan, people desirous of making bequests or gifts would do so very
  willingly when they knew they would be cared for and made use of; for it
  is probably the case that private libraries are more numerous here than
  abroad, and that there are altogether more books in the country. I am
  told by a correspondent that in his time there were no books at Christ's
  Hospital, therefore the bequest made is, I presume, a late one; and if
  such is the case, it will be a favourable opportunity for the governors
  of that school to enlarge the collection and make it available to the
  scholars.</p>

  <p>If, therefore, our schools are no better provided than our public
  libraries, the inquiry may be of service; but if they are, it cannot do
  harm to know their condition. It is true I have heard of but one public
  school hitherto that has no library and wants one, but I shall remain
  unsatisfied till other returns make their appearance in "N. &amp; Q." or
  privately, when, if it should appear I have taken a wrong opinion, I
  shall be as please as anybody else to find myself mistaken.</p>

  <p>In answer to your correspondent <span class="sc">Mr. Weld
  Taylor's</span> Query on this subject, may I be allowed to say that at
  Tonbridge School, where I was educated, there is a very good general
  library, consisting of the best classical works in our own language,
  travels, chronicles, histories, and the best works of fiction and poetry,
  and I believe all modern periodicals.</p>

  <p>This library is under the care of the head boy for the time being, and
  he, with the other monitors, acts as librarian. Books are given out, I
  believe, daily; the library is maintained by the boys themselves, and few
  leave the school without making some contribution to its funds, or
  placing some work on its shelves.</p>

  <p>The head master, the Rev. Dr. Welldon, approves of all books before
  they are added to the library.</p>

  <p>There is also what is called the "Sunday Library," consisting of
  standard works of theology and church history, and other works, chiefly
  presented by the head and other masters, to induce a taste for such
  reading.</p>

  <p>I am sorry that <span class="sc">Mr. Weld Taylor</span> should have to
  complain of the <i>general</i> ignorance of public schoolboys; but I know
  I may on behalf of the head boy of Tonbridge say, he will be happy to
  acknowledge any contribution from <span class="sc">Mr. Weld
  Taylor</span>, which he may be disposed to give, towards the removal of
  this charge.</p>

<h3>CAWDRAY'S "TREASURIE OF SIMILIES," AND SIMILE
OF MAGNETIC NEEDLE.</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 386.)</p>

  <p>There can be no doubt as to the authorship of the <i>Store-house of
  Similies</i>. The work is now before me, and the title-page is as
  follows:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Treasurie or Store-house of Similies; both Pleasaunt, Delightfull,
  and Profitable for all Estates of Men in Generall: newly collected into
  Heades and Common Places. By Robert Cawdray. London: printed by Thomas
  Creede, 1609."</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The only reference to his Life, which I can find, is in "The Epistle
  Dedicatorie;" and two ancestors of mine, "Sir John Harington, Knight, and
  the Worshipful James Harington, Esquire, his brother," in which, when
  assigning his reasons for the "Dedication," he says:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Calling to mind (right worshipfuls) not only the manifold curtesies
  and benefits, which I found and received, now more than thirty years ago,
  <i>when I taught the grammar schoole at Okeham in Rutland</i>, and sundry
  times since, of the religious and virtuous lady, Lucie Harington,"
  &amp;c.</p>

</blockquote>

  <p>The "Dedication" is subscribed "Robert Cawdray." Cawdray was also the
  author of a work <i>On the Profit and Necessity of Catechising</i>,
  London, 1592, 8vo.</p>

  <p class="author"><span class="sc">E. C. Harington.</span></p>

  <p class="address">The Close, Exeter.</p>

<hr class="short" />

  <p>The "Epistle Dedicatorie," as well as the title-page, appears to be
  wanting in J.&nbsp;H.&nbsp;S.'s copy of Robert Cawdray's <i>Store-house</i>, which
  was "printed by Thomas Creede, London, 1609." From this we find that it
  was dedicated to "his singular benefactors, Sir John Harington, Knight,
  as also to the Worshipfull James Harington, Esquire, his brother," whose
  "great kindness and favourable good will (during my long trouble, and
  since)" the author afterwards "calls to mind," and also the "manifold
  curtesies and benefites which I found and received, now more than thirtie
  years agoe (when I taught the Grammar School at Okeham in Rutland, and
  sundrie times since) of the religious and vertuous lady, <i>Lucie
  Harington</i> your Worship's Mother, and my especial friend in the Lord."
  Would this be the "lady, a prudent woman," who "had the princess
  Elizabeth committed to her government" (vide Fuller's <i>Worthies</i>,
  Rutlandshire)?</p>

  <p>J. H. S.'s Query recalls two examples of the "magnetic needle simile"
  (Vol. vi. and vii. <i>passim</i>), which Cawdray has garnered in his
  <i>Store-house</i>, and which fact would probably account for their
  appearance in many sermons of the period, as the book being expressly
  intended to "lay open, rip up, and display in their kindes," "verie manie
  most horrible and foule vices and dangerous sinnes of all sorts;" and the
  "verie fitte similitudes" being for the most part "borrowed from manie
  kindes and sundrie naturall things, both in the Olde and New Testament,"
  and being as the writer says "for preachers profitable," would find a
  place on many a clerical shelf; and its contents be freely used to
  "learnedly beautifie their matter, and brauely garnish and decke out"
  their discourses. I fear that I have already encroached too much on your
  valuable space, but send copies for use at discretion. In the first, the
  "Sayler's Gnomon" is used as an emblem of the constancy which ought to
  animate every "Christian man;" and in the second, of steadfastness amidst
  the temptations of the world. I shall be glad to know more of Cawdray
  than the trifles I have gathered from his book:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Euen as the Sayler's Gnomon, or rule, which is commonly called the
  mariner's needle, doth alwayes looke towards the north poole, and will
  euer turne towards the same, howsoeuer it bee placed: which is maruellous
  in that instrument and needle, whereby the mariners doo knowe the course
  of the windes: Euen so euerie Christian man ought to direct the eyes of
  his minde, and the wayes of his heart, to Christ; who is our north poole,
  and that fixed and constant north starre, whereby we ought all to bee
  governed: for hee is our hope and our trust; hee is our strength,
  whereupon wee must still relie."</p>

  <p>"Like as the Gnomon dooth euer beholde the north starre, whether it be
  closed and shutte uppe in a coffer of golde, siluer, or woode, neuer
  loosing his nature: So a faithfull Christian man, whether hee abound in
  wealth, or bee pinched with pouertie, whether hee bee of high or lowe
  degree in this worlde, ought continually to haue his faith and hope
  surely built and grounded uppon Christ: and to haue his heart and minde
  fast fixed and settled in him, and to follow him through thicke and
  thinne, through fire and water, through warres and peace, through hunger
  and colde, through friendes and foes, through a thousand perilles and
  daungers, through the surges and waues of enuie, malice, hatred, euill
  speeches, rayling sentences, contempt of the worlde, flesh, and diuell:
  and, euen in death itselfe, bee it neuer so bitter, cruell, and
  tyrannicall; yet neuer to loose the sight and viewe of Christ, neuer to
  giue ouer our faith, hope, and trust in him."</p>

  <p>Robert Cawdray, the author of <i>A Treasurie or Store-house of
  Similes</i>, was a Nonconformist divine of learning and piety. Having
  entered into the sacred function about 1566, he was presented by
  Secretary Cecil to the rectory of South Luffenham in Rutlandshire. After
  he had been employed in the ministry about twenty years, he was cited
  before Bishop Aylmer and other high commissioners, and charged with
  having omitted parts of the Book of Common Prayer in public worship, <!--
  Page 500 --><span class="pagenum"><a name="page500"></a>{500}</span>and
  with having preached against certain things contained in the book. Having
  refused, according to Strype, to take the oath to answer all such
  articles as the commissioners should propose, he was deprived of his
  ministerial office. Mr. Brook, however, in his <i>Lives of the
  Puritans</i>, states that though he might at first have refused the oath,
  yet that he afterwards complied, and gave answers to the various articles
  which he proceeds to detail at length. He was cited again on two
  subsequent occasions; and, on his third appearance, being required to
  subscribe, and to wear the surplice, he refused, and was imprisoned, and
  ultimately deprived. He applied to Lord Burleigh to intercede on his
  behalf, and his lordship warmly espoused his cause, and engaged Attorney
  Morrice to undertake his defence, but his arguments proved ineffectual.
  Mr. Cawdray, refusing to submit, was brought before Archbishop Whitgift,
  and other high commissioners, May 14, 1590, and was degraded and deposed
  from the ministry and made a mere layman. The above account is abridged
  from Brook's <i>Lives of the Puritans</i>, London, 1813, pp. 430-43.</p>

  <p>"A Table Alphabeticall; conteyning and teaching the True Writing and
  Vnderstanding of hard vsuall English Wordes, borrowed from the Hebrew,

  <p>Cawdray was rector of South Luffenham, in Rutland; and was deprived by
  Bishop Aylmer for nonconformity in 1587. He appealed to the Court of
  Exchequer, and his case was argued before all the judges in 1591. A
  report of the trial is in Coke's <i>Reports</i>, inscribed "De Jure Regis
  Ecclesiastico." There is a Life of Cawdray in Brook's <i>Lives of the
  Puritans</i> (vol. i. pp. 430-443.), which contains an interesting
  account of his examination before the High Commission, extracted from a
  MS. register. Notices of him will also be found in Neal's
  <i>Puritans</i>, 1837 (vol. i. pp. 330. 341.); and Heylin's <i>History of

<h3>"MARY, WEEP NO MORE FOR ME."</h3>

<p class="cenhead">(Vol. viii., p. 385.)</p>

  <p>For the following information respecting the author, and the original,
  I am indebted to the <i>Lady's Magazine</i> of 1820, from which I copied
  it several years ago.</p>

  <p>Mr. Joseph Lowe, born at Kenmore in Galloway, 1750, the son of a
  gardener, at fourteen apprenticed to a weaver, by persevering diligence
  in the pursuit of knowledge, was enabled in 1771 to enter himself a
  student in Divinity in the University of Edinburgh. On his return from
  college he became tutor in the family of a gentleman, Mr.
  M<sup>c</sup>Ghie of Airds, who had several beautiful daughters, to one
  of whom he was attached, though it never was their fate to be united.
  Another of the sisters, Mary, was engaged to a surgeon, Mr. Alexander
  Miller. This young gentleman was unfortunately lost at sea, an event
  immortalised by <i>Mary's Dream</i>. The author was unhappy in his
  marriage with a lady of Virginia, whither he had emigrated, and died in
  1798. This poem was originally composed in the Scottish dialect, and
  afterwards received the polished English form from the hand of its
  author.</p>

<h3>PHOTOGRAPHIC CORRESPONDENCE.</h3>

  <p><i>Clouds in Photographs</i> (Vol. viii., p. 451.).&mdash;Your
  correspondent on this subject may easily produce clouds on paper
  negatives by drawing in the lights on the back with common writing ink.
  There is usually some tint printed with all negatives, therefore the
  black used will stop it out.</p>

  <p>It is at the same time unfair and untrue to the art, because clouds
  cannot be represented in the regular mode of practice. If they appear, as
  they do sometimes by accident, it is well to leave them; but in no art is
  any trick so easily detected as in photography, and it cannot add to any
  operator's credit in expertness to practise them.</p>

  <p class="author">W. T.</p>

  <p><i>Albumenized Paper.</i>&mdash;In a late Number of "N. &amp; Q." you
  published an account of albumenizing paper for positives by <span
  class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt</span>. Having considerable experience in the
  manipulation of photographical art, I have bestowed great pains in
  testing the process he recommends; and, I regret to say, the results are
  by no means satisfactory. I well know the delicacy which is required in
  applying the albumen <i>evenly</i> to the surface of the paper, and am
  therefore not surprised to find that each of his "longitudinal strokes"
  remains clearly indicated, thereby entirely destroying the effect of the
  picture.</p>

  <p>He also advises that the paper should not be afterwards <i>ironed</i>,
  as it is apt to produce flaws and spots on the albumenized surface; and
  he believes that the chemical action of the nitrate of silver alone is
  sufficient to coagulate the albumen, without the application of heat.
  This I have found <i>in practice</i> to be incorrect: for when I have
  excited albumenized paper, to which a sufficient heat has not been
  applied, I have invariably observed that a portion of the albumen becomes
  detached into the silver solution, making it viscid, and favouring its
  decomposition. Consequently, the sheets <i>last</i> excited seldom retain
  their colour so long as those which are first prepared. But even laying
  aside the question of the coagulation of the albumen, the paper, unless
  it is ironed, remains so "cockled up," that it is not only unsightly, but
  very difficult to use. 100-grain solution of nitrate of silver (I presume
  to the ounce) is also recommended. In a late Number, I find <span
  class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> uses a 40-grain solution with perfect
  success; and my own experience enables me to verify this formula as being
  sufficiently powerful:&mdash;no additional intensity of colour being
  obtained by these strong solutions, it is a mere waste of material.
  Therefore I think your correspondent fails in effecting either economy of
  material or time.</p>

  <p>However painful it may be to me to offer remarks at variance with the
  opinions of your kind and intelligent correspondents, yet I consider it a
  duty that yourself and readers should not be misled, and so interesting
  and elegant an art as photography brought into disrepute by experiments
  which, however well intentioned, plainly indicate a want of
  experience.</p>

  <p class="author">K. N. M.</p>

<div class="note">
  <p>[<span class="sc">Mr. Shadbolt's</span> scientific acquirements
  appeared to us to demand that we should give insertion to his plan of
  albumenizing paper: although we felt some doubts whether it did not
  contain the disadvantages which our correspondent now points out. We had
  met with such complete success in following out the process recommended
  by <span class="sc">Dr. Diamond</span> in our 205th Number, that we did
  not think it advisable to make any alteration. For our own experience has
  shown us the wisdom, in photography as in other matters, of holding fast
  that which is good.&mdash;<span class="sc">Ed.</span>]</p>

</div>

  <p><i>Stereoscopic Angles.</i>&mdash;Notwithstanding the space you have
  devoted to this subject, I find little practical information to the
  photographer: will you therefore allow me to presume to offer you my
  mode, which, regardless of all scientific rules, I find to be perfectly
  successful in obtaining the desired results?</p>

  <p>My focussing-glass is ruled with a few perpendicular and horizontal
  lines with a pencil, and I also cross it from corner to corner, which
  marks the centre of the glass. These lines always allow me to place my
  camera level, because the perpendicular lines being parallel with any
  upright line secures it.</p>

  <p>Having taken a picture, I note well the spot of some object near the
  centre of the picture: thus, if a window or branch of a tree be upon the
  spot where the lines cross <a href="images/212_073.png"><img
  src="images/212_073.png" class="middle" style="height:1.5ex" alt="Cross
  lines" /></a>, I remove the camera in a straight line about one foot for
  every ten yards distance from the subject, and bring the same object to
  the same spot: I believe it is not very important if the camera is moved
  more or less. This may be known and practised by many of your friends;
  but I am sure others make a great difficulty in effecting those
  satisfactory results which, as I have shown, may be so easily
  obtained.</p>

  <p><i>Photographic Copies of MSS.</i>&mdash;I am glad to find from your
  Notices to Correspondents in Vol. viii., p. 456., that the applicability
  of photography to the copying of MSS., or printed leaves, is beginning to
  excite attention. The facility and cheapness of thus applying it (as I
  have been informed by a professional photographer) is so great, that I
  have no doubt but that we shall shortly have it used in our great public
  libraries; so as to supersede the present slow, expensive, and uncertain
  process of copying by hand. And it is in order to help to bring about so
  desirable a state of things, that I send these few lines to your
  widely-circulated journal.</p>

  and bulky articles to which he refers: perhaps there may be as many as
  would make it worth the while of some publisher to furnish one. Of course
  copyright, and all sorts of rights, must be respected but that being
  done, there would be little else to do than to cut out and wheel away the
  heavy articles from a copy of any encyclopÃ¦dia, and put the rest into the
  hands of a printer. The residuum (which is what we want) would probably
  be to a considerable extent the same. When necessary additions had been

  <p><i>Black as a mourning Colour</i> (Vol. viii., p.
  411.).&mdash;Mourning habits are said first to appear in England in the
  time of Edward III. Chaucer and Froissart are the first who mention them.
  The former, in <i>Troylus and Creseyde</i>, says:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"Creseyde was in widowe's habit <i>black</i>."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Again:</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"My clothes everichone</p>
      <p>Shall <i>blacke</i> ben, in tolequyn, herte swete,</p>
      <p>That I am as out of this world gone."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Again, in the <i>Knights Tale</i>, Palamon appeared at a funeral</p>

  <div class="poem">
    <div class="stanza">
      <p class="hg3">"In clothes <i>black</i> dropped all with tears."</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <p>Froissart says, the Earl of Foix clothed himself and household in
  <i>black</i> on the death of his son. At the funeral of the Earl of
  Flanders black gowns were worn. On the death of King John of France, the
  King of Cyprus wore black. The very mention of these facts would suggest
  that black was not then universally worn, but being gradually adopted for
  mourning.</p>

  <p><i>Chanting of Jurors</i> (Vol. vi., p. 315.).&mdash;No answer has yet
  been given to J.&nbsp;F.&nbsp;F.'s Query on this, yet the expression "to chant" was
  not an unusual one, if we may believe Lord Stratford:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"They collected a grand jury in each county, and proceeded to claim a
  ratification of the rights of the crown. The gentlemen on being
  empanelled informed that the case before them was irresistible, and that
  no doubts could exist in the minds of reasonable <!-- Page 503 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page503"></a>{503}</span>men upon it. His
  majesty was, in fact, indifferent whether they found for him or no. 'And
  there I left them,' says Strafford, '<i>to chant</i> together, as they
  call it, over their evidence.' The counties of Roscommon, Sligo, and Mayo
  instantly found a title for the king."</p>

  word in an epitaph in St. Stephen's, Norwich, and asks where else it may
  be met with. I have just found it in a manuscript diary, under date 1561,
  and also as used in the same city:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"A Speech made after Mr. Mayor Mingay's Dinner.</p>

  <p>"Master Mayor of Norwich; an it please your worship you have feasted
  us like a kinge. God bless the Queen's grace. We have fed plentifully,
  and now whilom I can speak plain English, I heartily thank you Master
  Mayor, and so do we all. Answer, boys, answer! Your beere is pleasant and
  potent, and soon catches us by the caput and stops our manners, and so
  Huzza for the Queen's Majesty's Grace, and all her bonny brow'd dames of

  and his faire <i>Aldress</i>; there they are, God save them and all this
  jolly company. To all our friends round country who have a penny in their
  purse, and an English heart in their bodies, to keep out Spanish Dons and

  <p><i>Huggins and Muggins</i> (Vol. viii., p. 341.).&mdash;In the edition
  of Mallet's <i>Northern Antiquities</i>, edited by J.&nbsp;A. Blackwell, Esq.,
  and published by Bohn (<i>Antiquarian Library</i>, 1847), the following
  conjectural etymology of the words Huggins and Muggins is given by the
  editor in a note on the word <i>Muninn</i>, in the glossary to the Prose
  Edda:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"We cannot refrain for once from noticing the curious coincidence
  between the names of Odin's ravens, Hugin and Munin&mdash;Mind and
  Memory&mdash;and those of two personages who figure so often in our comic
  literature as Messrs. Huggins and Muggins. <i>Huggins</i>, like
  <i>Hugh</i>, appears to have the same root as <i>Hugin</i>, viz.
  <i>hugr</i>, mind, spirit; and as Mr. Muggins is as invariably associated
  with Mr. Huggins, as one of Odin's ravens was with the other (as mind is
  with memory), the name may originally have been written <i>Munnins</i>,
  and <i>nn</i> changed into <i>gg</i> for the sake of euphony. Should this
  <i>conjecture</i>, for it is nothing else, be well founded, one of the
  most poetical ideas in the whole range of mythology would, in this
  plodding, practical, spilling-jenny age of ours, have thus undergone a
  most singular metamorphosis."</p>

  <p><i>Camera Lucida</i> (Vol. viii., p. 271.).&mdash;With my camera

  class="sc">Caret</span>:</p>

<blockquote class="b1n">

  <p>"Those who cannot sketch comfortably, without perfect distinctness of
  both the pencil and object, must observe, that the <i>stem</i> should be
  drawn out to the mark D, for all distant objects, and to the numbers 2,
  3, 4, 5, &amp;c. for objects that are at the distances of only 2, 3, 4,
  or 5 feet respectively, the stem being duly inclined according to a mark
  placed at the bottom; but, after a little practice, such exactness is
  wholly unnecessary. The farther the prism is removed from the paper, that
  is, the longer the stem is drawn out, the larger the objects will be
  represented in the drawing, and accordingly the less extensive the
  view.</p>

  <p>"The nearer the prism is to the paper, the smaller will be the
  objects, and the more extensive the view comprised on the same piece of
  paper.</p>

  <p>"If the drawing be two feet from the prism, and the paper only one
  foot, the copy will be half the size of the original. If the drawing be
  at one foot, and the paper three feet distant, the copy will be three
  times as large as the original: and so for all other distances."</p>

  <p><i>Oaths of Pregnant Women</i> (Vol. v., p. 393.).&mdash;Women of the
  humbler classes in the British Islands appear to have an objection, when
  pregnant, to take an oath. I have not observed any attempt to explain or
  account for this prejudice. The same objection exists among the Burmese.
  Indeed, pregnant women there are, by long-observed custom, absolved from
  taking an oath, and affirm to their depositions, "remembering their
  pregnant condition." The reason of this is as follows. The system of
  Budhism, as it prevails in the Indo-Chinese countries, consists
  essentially in the negation of a Divine Providence. The oath of Budhists
  is an imprecation of evil on the swearer, <!-- Page 504 --><span
  class="pagenum"><a name="page504"></a>{504}</span>addressed to the innate
  rewarding powers of nature, animate and inanimate, if the truth be not
  spoken. This evil may be instantaneous, as sudden death from a fit, or
  from a flash of lightning; the first food taken may choke the false
  swearer; or on his way home, a tiger by land, or an alligator by water,
  may seize and devour him. I have known an instance of this occur, which
  was spoken of by hundreds as a testimony to the truth of the system. Now
  it is supposed by Budhists that even an unconscious departure from truth
  may rouse jealous nature to award punishment. In the case of pregnant
  women this would involve the unborn offspring in the calamity. Hence
  women in that condition do not take an oath in Burmah.</p>

  <p><i>Lepel's Regiment</i> (Vol. vii., p. 501.).&mdash;J.&nbsp;K. may rest

  which existed in the year 1707. I have searched the lists of cavalry and
  infantry regiments at the battle of Almanza, fought April 25th of that
  year, and do not find this regiment mentioned. May I substitute for
  "Lepel's" regiment, "Pepper's" regiment? The colonelcy of that corps, now
  the 8th Royal Irish Hussars, became vacant by the fall of
  Brigadier-General Robert Killigrew at Almanza, and it was immediately
  conferred on the lieutenant-colonel of the corps, John Pepper, who held
  it until March 23, 1719.</p>

  <p><i>Creole</i> (Vol. vii., p. 381. Vol. viii., p. 138.).&mdash;I have
  never met with any satisfactory explanation of the origin of this word;
  its meaning has undergone various modifications. At first it was limited
  in its application to the descendants of Europeans born in the colonies.
  By degrees it came to be extended to all classes of the population of
  colonial descent and now it is indiscriminately employed to express
  things as well as persons, of local origin or growth. We say a
  <i>creole</i> Negro, as contra-distinguished from a negro born in Africa
  or elsewhere; a <i>creole</i> horse, as contra-distinguished from an
  English or an American horse; and we speak "Creole" when we address the
  uneducated classes in their native jargon.</p>

  of the family of Geering, Gearing, or Geary, of South Denchworth in the
  co. of Berks, of which family I have a pedigree. I can also supply their

  <p>The Geerings bought the manor of Viscount Cullen. It was formerly in
  the possession of the Hydes: several of the Geering monuments are in the
  church. Their arms, Or, on two bars gules six mascles of the field, on a
  canton sable a leopard's face of the first. The Geerings were long
  tenants of a part of the estate which they purchased; they are extinct in
  the male line. A grandson, John Bockett, Esq. (by the female line), of
  the last heir, possessed a small farm in the parish which was sold by him
  some years ago. The manor now belongs to Worcester College, Oxford, who
  purchased it of Gregory Geering, gent., in 1758. The name is spelt
  Gearing and Geary in the early registers.</p>

  <p>The books in the small study (mentioned in "N. &amp; Q." some time
  ago) were given by Gregory Geering, Esq., Mr. Ralph Kedden, vicar of
  Denchworth, and Mr. Edward Brewster, stationer, of London, most of which
  are attached by long chains to the cases.</p>

  <p><i>Island</i> (Vol. viii., p. 279.).&mdash;H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. is quite right in
  saying that the <i>s</i> has been inserted in this word: not, however, as
  he thinks, "to assimilate <!-- Page 505 --><span class="pagenum"><a
  name="page505"></a>{505}</span>the Saxon and French terms," but from a
  fancied French or Latin derivation, just as <i>rime</i> is spelt
  <i>rhyme</i>, because it was fancied that it came from <span
  title="rhuthmos" class="grk"
  >&#x1FE5;&upsilon;&theta;&mu;&#x1F78;&sigmaf;</span>; and as critics and
  editors will print <i>c&oelig;lum</i> instead of <i>cÃ¦lum</i>, contrary
  to all authority, because they have taken it into their heads that it
  comes from <span title="koilon" class="grk"
  >&kappa;&omicron;&#x1FD6;&lambda;&omicron;&nu;</span>. We have also
  <i>spright</i>, <i>impregnable</i>, and other misspelt words, for which
  it is difficult to assign a reason. But I think H.&nbsp;C.&nbsp;K. is altogether
  mistaken in connecting the A.-S. <i>ig</i> (pr. <i>ee</i>), an island,
  with <i>eye</i>. It is evidently one of the original underived nouns of
  the Teutonic family, being <i>ig</i> A.-S., <i>ey</i> Icel., whence
  <i>Ã¶</i> Swed., <i>Ã¶</i> or <i>Ã¶e</i> Dan., and which also appears in the
  German and Dutch <i>eiland</i>; while in the words for <i>eye</i> the
  <i>g</i> is radical, as <i>eage</i> A.-S., <i>auga</i> Icel., <i>auge</i>
  Germ., <i>oog</i> Dutch.</p>

  <p>THE REVALENTA ARABICA FOOD, the only natural, pleasant, and effectual

  fifty times its cost in other remedies) for nervous, stomachic,
  intestinal, liver and bilious complaints, however deeply rooted,

  <p class="author">"Bonn, July 19. 1852.</p>

  <p>"This light and pleasant Farina is one of the most excellent,
  nourishing, and restorative remedies, and supersedes, in many cases, all
  kinds of medicines. It is particularly useful in confined habit of body,
  as also diarrh&oelig;a, bowel complaints, affections of the kidneys and
  bladder, such as stone or gravel; inflammatory irritation and cramp of
  the urethra, cramp of the kidneys and bladder, strictures, and
  hemorrhoids. This really invaluable remedy is employed with the most
  satisfactory result, not only in bronchial and pulmonary complaints,
  where irritation and pain are to be removed, but also in pulmonary and
  bronchial consumption, in which it counteracts effectually the
  troublesome cough; and I am enabled with perfect truth to express the
  conviction that Du Barry's Revalenta Arabica is adapted to the cure of
  incipient hectic complaints and consumption.</p>
